# GBS Payment Processor - Authorize.net CIM

Authorize.net CIM Add-on.

## Important Note

This is a premium add-on that is sold in the GBS Marketplace (url coming soon). If you want to use this add-on please purchase it.

I've made this add-on public via github as an experiment to measure a few things:

* Developer involvement - Pull Requests!
* Customer involvement - Customers have requested to see development progress
* Financially viability - Is providing this add-on going to create more sales to help future development or create a dead project

What are your thoughts?
